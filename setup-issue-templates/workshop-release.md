In [`AlexsLemonade/training-modules`](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules), [create a new release](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules/releases/new) that ties that material to this specific workshop. We use the convention `<year>-<month>` for tags and `<year> <month>` for release titles for CCDL workshops.

Don't forget to update the `_config.yaml` file in _this repository_ to point to the correct the release.
