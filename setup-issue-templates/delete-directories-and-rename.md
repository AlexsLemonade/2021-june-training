- [ ] Delete the irrelevant `*-workshop` folder. 
If your workshop is a virtual workshop, remove the `in-person-workshop` folder. 
If your workshop is an in-person workshop, remove the `virtual-workshop` folder.
	- If you're running an in-person workshop, you will not need the `virtual-setup` folder, either.
- [ ] Rename the relevant `*-workshop` folder to `workshop`. 
For a virtual workshop, `virtual-workshop` should be renamed to `workshop`.
Changing this folder name will make several links in the repository work â€“there are instances where we link to a schedule with `../workshop/SCHEDULE.md`, for example.
