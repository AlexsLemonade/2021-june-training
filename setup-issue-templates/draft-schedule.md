Update `workshop/SCHEDULE.md` to point to appropriate materials for your workshop.

  - Add relative links to PDFs in `slides` to the schedule.
  - We recommend using [htmlpreview](https://github.com/htmlpreview/htmlpreview.github.com) to display rendered versions of R Notebooks that are tied to a specific release in the [`AlexsLemonade/training-modules`](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules). You can use the `{{site.release_tag}}` convention used throughout the template.
