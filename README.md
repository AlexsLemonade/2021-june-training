## Local development 

It can be helpful to build the GitHub pages site locally to check that passing parameter values is working as expected. 
The following instructions are for Mac OS and have only been used on Mojave. 

1. Make sure you have [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed. Installation can be accomplished with `gem install bundler`.
 
  If you encounter a permissions error, it was solved (using this StackOverflow post as a guide) with the following on Mojave with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

  ```
  # install rbenv
  brew update
  brew install rbenv

  # add to ~/.bash_profile
  echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```

  Start a new shell to initialize `rbenv`.

  ```
  # install and setup v2.7.1 of Ruby
  rbenv install 2.7.1
  rbenv shell 2.7.1
  rbenv rehash
  ``` 

  Now you're ready to run `gem install bundler`. 

2. Install Jekyll (`gem install jekyll`).
3. Run `bundle install` from the root of this repository, where the `Gemfile` is located.
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and navigate to the server address.

If you've already followed the steps above and are in a new shell, run the following steps to build locally:

```
rbenv shell 2.7.1
rbenv rehash
bundle exec jekyll serve  
```
